### What I learned

I learned how to create a simple form using HTML and style it with CSS.  
I practiced working with input fields, buttons, and icons, and improved my understanding of layout and spacing.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - HTML Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) - This helped me understand how to structure forms and use input fields correctly.
- [CSS Tricks - Styling Forms](https://css-tricks.com/complete-guide-to-forms/) - This article gave me practical tips for styling forms, buttons, and spacing to make the design clean and user-friendly.
